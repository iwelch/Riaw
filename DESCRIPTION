The chapter 9 referred to here basically recommends your the second pattern. But note that, if you want to use the first pattern, the correct way to do it is with importing the function (or whole package) in the NAMESPACE. This is described in chapter 10. In short, in the NAMESPACE file, you can add import(sf) or importFrom(sf, st_as_sf), and then just use them in your code as if you had called library(sf). If you use Roxygen, don't miss the practical explanations in Chapter 11.

One more note: calling library(sf) is more equivalent to adding a Depends in the DESCRIPTION. There are details in chapter 10. You should almost always prefer Imports to Depends.

Suggestions:  https://r-pkgs.org/code.html  --- a lot of good advice

Don't import (require) other libraries.

Don’t use library() or require(). These modify the search path, affecting what functions are available from the global environment. Instead, you should use the DESCRIPTION to specify your package’s requirements, as described in Chapter 9. This also makes sure those packages are installed when your package is installed.
