# TODO

## Add

* create an optional argument for stopifnot: msg="..."

* Is there a "hook-before" function in R?

* a text() function that sets a background (usually white)

* check how .Rout is created in interactive vs. command line invokation

* wrap 'pos=' for text() argument seamlessly, so I can use 't', 'b', 'l', 'r'


## Maybe Add

* create a 'die' instruction, possibly a stop with a glue estring

* allow rbind.oc.by to have its middle argument default to the data frame in the first argument.

* deprecate fama-macbeth

* add argument to plot for second x and second y axis ... if plot can be made extensible


## Better Errors

* extend subset first to check if the selects exist.

* rename points.toomany in plots


## Checks to perform

* does native.slope.angle work?

* what are recode and refactor?

* what is enable.error.line.num ?

* is nona(df) possible?  na.omit(df)
